          <h3>Vicious Cycles Website</h3>

          <img src="viciouswebsite.png" alt="screenshot of vicious cycles website home page">

          <p>For my first web design project, I created a website for Vicious Cycles to educate and attract viewers to their motorcycles and trade shows. I used black, grey, and white colors with a dusty orange accent color to match their logo. I had difficulties with CSS, specifically flexbox and positioning.  I stuck to it and managed to at least create a visually pleasing desktop format. As far as the mobile design, there is much that I can improve on. Viewed on a mobile device, the Vicious Cycles website's text is too small for my liking and the positioning is off. I was focused more so on responsiveness than the mobile design. For my next project, I will learn more about responsive mobile design so that I can better implement my visions.</p>
